# Mallipedhi-Activity15-repo
Activity #15 - Repository for STAT 184 Activity #14, including QMD, PDF, issues, branching, and plan

This repository contains my files and work for Activity #14.

## Contents
- `activityyy14.qmd` — Quarto document used for the activity  
- `stat184activity14.pdf` — Rendered PDF submitted to Canvas  
- Plan for creating/maintaining the repo  
- Notes about Git branches, issues, and pull requests

## Plan: Creating & Maintaining the Repo

1. Create a public GitHub repository named `stat184-activity14` (or similar).
2. Add a README file describing the purpose and files in the repo.
3. Create a new branch to work on changes instead of editing `main` directly.
4. Use issues to track tasks (ex: "Upload QMD/PDF", "Write README and plan").
5. Make small, meaningful commits with descriptive messages.
6. Open pull requests to merge changes from branches into `main`.
7. Keep the repository updated with any fixes or improvements.

## Plan: Activity #14 Work

1. Prepare the QMD file in RStudio with all required sections.
2. Render the QMD file to create the PDF.
3. Upload both QMD and PDF to this repo.
4. Review files to make sure everything knits correctly and looks complete.
